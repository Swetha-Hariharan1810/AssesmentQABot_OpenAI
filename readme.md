Build an information retrieval system (Q&amp;A bot) 
that can interface with your data (multiple pdf files) 
and accurately respond to queries related to the contents 
of these files. This Q&amp;A bot must be built using a 
generative AI service OpenAILLMs. Please note that the bot 
will only respond to queries which are within the scope 
of uploaded documents.

   ```
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   ```
